# covid-cnn-detection
This project uses deep learning techniques to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it automates the classification of X-ray scans as either COVID-positive or normal, supporting faster medical triage during pandemic conditions.
